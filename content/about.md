Hi, I'm Sung Hyun (Greg). I am working towards entering robotics, and I am learning control theory and machine learning. In my spare time, I like reading (currently on Nexus by Yuval Noah Harari), learning to play the guitar, and enjoying my school days with friends.  

I’m also studying reinforcement learning in my spare time, and I’m interested in research and methods to deploy models into hardware.
