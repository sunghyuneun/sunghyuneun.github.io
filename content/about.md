Hi, I'm Sung Hyun (Greg). I am working towards entering robotics, and I am studying control theory and machine learning. In my spare time, I like reading (currently on Nexus by Yuval Noah Harari), learning to play the guitar, and enjoying my school days with friends.


In my spare time, I am constantly learning new topics (Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Statistics, Linear Algebra), and Iâ€™m interested in research and methods to deploy RL models into hardware.
