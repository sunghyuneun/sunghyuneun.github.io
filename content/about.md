Hi, I'm Sung Hyun (Greg). I am working towards entering robotics, and I am studying reinforcement learning for motion control outside of school. In my spare time, I like reading (currently on Nexus by Yuval Noah Harari and The Economist's Espresso), learning to play the guitar, and enjoying my school days with friends.


I am constantly learning new topics (Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Statistics, Linear Algebra), and I’m interested in research and methods to deploy RL models into hardware.
