## NMIST Dataset Classification
Implemented two neural networks on Kaggle to classify hand-drawn numbers from the NMIST dataset.
One was manually created with only NumPy to understand the mathematics of forward propagation, backward propagation, weights, bias, and gradient descent.
Other utilized PyTorch to create the neural network. 

## Misc Projects
I implemented Vectors as a class in OOP/Vector.py.
Added vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and equal.
I promise I know DSA
