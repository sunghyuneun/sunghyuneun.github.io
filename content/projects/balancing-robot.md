Created a simple balancing robot model in Gazebo, with rectangular prism and wheels.

# Gazebo Simulation - PID

Successful Balancing PID Program


# RL Controls
See ML projects for CartPole (Basic RL controls)

What's next: 
- Cascading PID Control. Angle PID inner loop, velocity PID outer loop
- Reinforcement learning controls in Gazebo (or Isaac)


# Physical Model
In progress, will use Arduino, Stepper Motors, MPU6050 IMU
