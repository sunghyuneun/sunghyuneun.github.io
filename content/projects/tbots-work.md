## Official Team Work

1. Used MATLAB and control theory to model a stable closed-loop controller in Field Oriented Control for our motors. 
2. Redesigned differential op-amp current sense circuit on Motor Driver board, essential to Field Oriented Control. Designed input differential low-pass filter, and an anti-aliasing low-pass filter to filter out crosstalk. Used LTSpice with small-signal AC analysis bode plot to verify circuit functionality.


## Buck Converter Design

Also specified parts and designed for a 12V to 5V buck converter in my Thunderbots Electrical team application.
