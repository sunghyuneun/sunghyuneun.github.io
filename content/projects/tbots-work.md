Work on Two main projects

1. Rewriting firmware for Motor Drivers, using control theory to create a stable closed-loop controller. 
2. Redesigned differential op-amp current sense circuit on Motor Driver board, essential to Field Oriented Control. Designed input differential low-pass filter, and an anti-aliasing low-pass filter to filter out crosstalk. Used LTSpice with small-signal AC analysis bode plot to verify functional circuit


Also worked on and specced a basic buck converter. 

There is a 12V to 5V buck converter I picked out parts and designed in my Thunderbots Electrical team application
