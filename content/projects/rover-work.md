# Projects

1. Designed and 3D printed an organizer to hold stepper motor drivers, screw terminals, Teensy, and aviator connectors. Designed for cable organization, motor driver heat dissipation, and ease of use. 
2. Redesigned and 3D printed parts for Axis 4 (the "elbow") of Arm, from belt-driven to an internal gear mechanism. Researched angled roller bearings, BLDC motors, and gears to specifications. 
3. Improved Wrist Differential Drive Uprights to deform less due to a moment caused by belt tension. Conducted FEA Analysis on prototypes, and created a hybrid design that uses both PLA-CF with embedded sheet metal to balance weight and strength.
