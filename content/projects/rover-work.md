# Overview

I worked on 3 main projects while at UBC Rover. 
1. Designed and 3D printed an organizer to hold stepper motor drivers, screw terminals, Teensy, and aviator connectors. Designed for cable organization, motor driver heat dissipation, and ease of use. 
2. Redesigned and 3D printed parts for Axis 4 (the "elbow") of Arm, from belt-driven to an internal gear mechanism. Researched angled roller bearings, BLDC motors, and gears to specifications. 
3. Improved Wrist Differential Drive Uprights to deform less due to a moment caused by belt tension. Conducted FEA Analysis on prototypes, and created a hybrid design that uses both PLA-CF with embedded sheet metal to balance weight and strength. 

# Driver Organizer

As can be seen below, the terminal compactly organized 7 stepper motor drivers, 2 screw terminals, and a Teensy. The wires could also routed to the holes below, which were designed to have aviator connectors attached.

# Axis 4 Redesign

I redesigned the Axis 4 of the arm ("elbow") to use an internal gear, instead of our old belt-driven design. Because belts have to be constantly retensioned, we determined it would take less effort to maintain with an internal gear. The design is visible below, to the left of the pipe. On the right of the pipe is the Wrist Differential Uprights.

# Wrist Differential Upright Holders

I redesigned it to deform less, as well as conducting FEA analysis to analyze which locations need to be reinforced the most.
