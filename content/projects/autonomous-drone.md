# Progress

## LiDAR
Visualized LiDAR information from Raspberry Pi onto Desktop using RViz2.

After I moved, I could not set up proper port forwarding at my dorm between my Raspberry Pi and my VM, so I switched to Foxglove.

Here is an example Map with my robot and LiDAR visualized on it.

## Assembly
Finished the CAD assembly, and built it in real life.
