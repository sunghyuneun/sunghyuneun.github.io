# Professional Experience

## Mechanical Engineering Intern @ Global Gourmet Foods

May 2025 - Present 

- Containerized and edited a JavaScript web app using Docker, React.js, and MariaDB to digitize factory operation records
- Created a secure data bridge on a Zimaboard that collects PLC data on a network and displays it on a webpage on another network using Docker, Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana
- Deployed Proxmox VE to host virtual machines and run containerized programs across multiple factory computers
- Automated invoice processing flows with Microsoft Power Automate and Excel Scripts to reduce approval delays
- Generated flattened engineering drawings of 3D CAD models; exported DXF files for waterjet cutters, and researched appropriate conveyor components such as casters, bolts, and nuts
