# Professional Experience

## Mechanical Engineering Intern @ Global Gourmet Foods

May 2025 - Present 

- Created a secure data bridge on a Zimaboard that collects PLC data on a network and displays it on a
webpage on another network using Docker, Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana
- Deployed Proxmox VE to host virtual machines and run containerized programs across multiple computers
- Containerized, edited a JavaScript web app using Docker, React.js, and MariaDB to digitize factory records
- Automated invoice processing with Microsoft Power Automate and Excel Scripts to reduce approval delays
- Generated flattened engineering drawings of 3D CAD models; exported DXF files for waterjet cutters, and
researched appropriate conveyor components such as casters, bolts, and nuts
  

# Design Team Experience

## UBC Thunderbots, Electrical Subteam

Sept 2025 - Present

Firmware
- Developing Firmware for STM32 Microcontrollers on a Motor Driver board
- Simulating control model of Three-Phase Inverter in MATLAB and Simulink to measure dynamics of motor
and tune PI controller gains for Field Oriented Control (FOC)


Current Sense
- Redesigned differential op-amp current sense circuit on Motor Driver board for use with FOC
- Researched and calculated component values considering low-pass cutoff frequencies to filter out crosstalk
while maintaining signal integrity, achieving a clear cutoff frequency of 250 kHz
- Simulated circuit using LTSpice with small-signal AC analysis (Bode Plot) to verify stability and performance,
confirming 26 kHz FOC sampling requirement


## UBC Rover, Arm Mechanical Subteam

Sept 2024 - Dec 2025

- Employed SolidWorks to redesign forearm axis of motion from belt-driven arrangement to internal gear to
eliminate belt maintenance
- Researched and implemented tapered roller bearings, internal gears, and brushless DC motors for rotation
- Mentored 3 new mechanical team members in Solidworks and design fundamentals
- Replaced solid aluminum components with lighter PLA-CF and steel rods, reducing weight by 55%. Validated
structural integrity by conducting FEA with SolidWorks Simulation to confirm sufficient material strength at
stress concentrations
- Developed 3D-printed driver holders with aviator sockets using SolidWorks for ease of access in wiring
- Soldered aviator plugs and wires to drivers to establish connections to arm actuators and sensors
- Machined holes into a bevel gear using a milling machine to securely attach onto arm with fasteners
